On January 23, 2018, the City of New York announced that it was filing a <a href="https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=MQ0UU/RLWyBbxinxaYzw9w=="> 500-million-dollar lawsuit</a> against several prescription opioid providers.
Among the charges is the companies' practice of "deceptive marketing" of opioids for chronic pain which led to a trend of overprescribing and eventually, an epidemic of dependence and addiction.
The city is seeking damages for the money it has spent in fighting illnesses caused by opioid addiction.


                </p>
            <br>

            <p>The human cost of addiction is incalculable. Families can be torn apart, relationships can be forever tarnished, personal dreams vanquished.
              But across the nation, many state and local governments around the country<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/justice-department-join-wave-state-lawsuits-against-opioid-makers-sessions-n851721"> are taking legal action</a>  over the economic
              consequences of addiction as healthcare systems and social safety nets feel the strain of addressing the opioid epidemic.</p>
            <br>

            <p>
              "Municipalities are on the front lines of combating the opioid epidemic and are confronting the demands the epidemic has placed on municipal health,
              social welfare, child welfare, emergency response and law enforcement systems," the New York City lawsuit states.


            </p>
            <br>



            <p>
The lawsuit names the drug companies Purdue Pharma, Teva, Cephalon, Janssen, Johnson & Johnson, Endo, Allergan and various other subsidiaries and distributors as defendants.

            </p>

New York City hospitals saw nearly 45,000 emergency room visits for opioid-related overdoses in 2017, according to the Department of Health. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/nyc-opioid-crisis-has-cost-city-500-million-1519682333"> The city estimates</a> that cost of
 inpatient and emergency-room care in treating opioid-related illness has been about 350 million dollars. The city says it has also spent about 95 million dollars in treating opioid addiction
 through primary care, behavioral and chemical dependency programs.



            </p>

            <br>
            <p>
            "City hospitals bear the burden of treating uninsured individuals who need emergency or other treatment related to opioid addiction," the lawsuit reads. </p>
            <br>

            <p>In 2016, there were 1,374 drug overdose deaths in New York City. Eighty-two percent of these deaths were caused by heroin, fentanyl or prescription opioids. The number of overdose deaths
               rose by 437 from 2015 and the rates of overdose deaths in the city had doubled between 2010 and 2016.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
               Last year, the city launched the<a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/about/press/pr2017/healingnyc.page"> "Healing NYC"</a> program, with plans to spend 150 million dollars over five years expanding treatment options for New Yorkers and distributing 100,000
               naloxone kits to city residents through local nonprofits and healthcare providers. Naloxone is a drug that reverses an overdose and is often carried by emergency first responders.  </p>
            <br>

    Please note that the calculator above is only meant to provide a rough estimate of the costs. In the United States, of course, a combination of public and private dollars (through private insurance or Medicaid/Medicare, etc.) pay for healthcare, including treatment of opioid addiction, so the cost of treatment
    falls on both individuals and governments/society at large.
